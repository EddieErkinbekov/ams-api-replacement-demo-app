# Locate the User-Assigned Managed Identity

The user-assigned managed identity is needed for various configurations and permissions management.

Find it in the following way:
1. Go to the managed resource group created by the Ravnur Media Services deployment

2. Under the list of resources, go to the “Managed Identity” section

> The name of the Managed Identity will be unique for your specific deployment, however, it always follows a pattern "id-rms-\<unique-suffix\>"
